# The Cards Project

The project was developed in a team of three. <br>
To create tasks we've **used Jira**, got **git** to collaborate, and had **daily scrum meetings** to communicate and catch up with the team.

### `react redux react-redux react hooks formik`
### `jest unit tests material UI`
### `git JIRA`
